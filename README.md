### Hey there! ğŸ‘‹

My name is AndrÃ© Ferraz, I'm a software developer with over a decade of experience building websites for multinational brands, and passionate about game development.

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on an open-source project named [Faber CLI](https://github.com/faberjs/faber-cli), which is a CLI that helps you create and use pre-defined boilerplates.

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about automated tests with Jest and other tools.
